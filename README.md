When you want to use the website you need to have a database made. 
Follow the steps and try to login to try if it works!

1. Check if all of the files are in the localhost of xampp.
2. Check if you started the xammp 'Apache' AND 'MySQL'.
3. When MySQL has started press on 'Admin'. Now you will see the phpmyadmin.
4. Create a new database by pressing on new on the left and call it 'apothecare'.
   *MAKE SHURE THE DATABASE IS CALLED APOTHECARE OR THE WEBSITE WILL NOT LINK UP!!!*
5. Press on your new made database and press on 'inport'.
6. Press on 'Choose file' and find and select the other file named 'apothecare.sql' in the folder of this file.
7. Scroll down and press on "Inport".
